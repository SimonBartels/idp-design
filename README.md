# idp-design

This repository contains code corresponding to the paper titled "Generalized design of sequence-ensemble-function relationships for intrinsically disordered proteins." We provide code corresponding to two example optimizations -- radius of gyration (Rg) and salt sensor optimizations. Additional code is available upon request, and will be made public given sufficient demand.
